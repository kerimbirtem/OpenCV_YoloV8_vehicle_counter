# Vehicle Traffic Counter

This project aims to count vehicles passing through a road. It processes traffic camera footage taken from YouTube using the OpenCV library and a trained YOLOV8 model to count the vehicles passing through the road in the video. The project has 2 different versions.

## Version 1
Version 1 displays the total number of vehicles passing through the road in the video as well as the number of vehicles detected in real-time.
